					<h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
                    <p class="text-capitalize">4 months after writing my first Hello World program on August 8th 2018 using Python and Javascript While still Studying, I had to focus more during my holiday on intensive learning to be a software Engineer,after learning Python  for 4 month through youtube,Documentation and other Resources online.</p>
                    <p class="text-capitalize">i proceeded in  building calculator,banking system in python,todo app etc as my first projects which i am so happy about because it enhances my learning and increased my skills to get to this level by God's grace. in 2019 ,i started learning Django to build dynamic website because of my love for web Development,i built my personal website, Ecommerce and School Management system.</p>

					<p class="text-capitalize">Before I knew it i transitioned from the old system and i'm on the right path. My newbie self was now in charge of building and hosting of static, dynamic web apps and supporting hundreds of clients.</p>

					<p class="text-capitalize">From this you’ll see that I’m someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary and i love skills advancement.</p>
